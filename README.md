# Girish93-Web-Mashup-Display-House-Address-on-a-Map-with-Weather-details

Description:
This project is based on a web mashup which combines the services of Google maps and Geonames to display the weather parameters of a particular location. This project is implemented using JavaScript and AJAX. This application finds the address of a location based on a mouse click of an overlay marker using Google Maps reverse geocoding technique. After determining the address the weather parameters are determined using Geonames API. The call to the Geonames API is implemented using AJAX synchronous call. This project makes use of XMLHttpRequest to call the Geonames weather parameters asynchronously. The resulting output is displayed in XML format.  

Files:

webmash.js: JavaScript file for AJAX and HTTP requests

webmash.html: Design for the front-end

proxy.php: To avoid cross-domain restriction when using AJAX.
